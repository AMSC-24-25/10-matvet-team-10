## TASK 3: Sparse Matrix Implementation and Testing

### Overview
this task focused on implementing and testing a sparse matrix using the Eigen library. Our goal was to efficiently handle matrix-vector multiplication and save the results to a file.

### Implementation Details
1. **Sparse Matrix Initialization**:
   Using Eigen library to load a sparse matrix from a `.mtx` file, Using Eigen's `loadMarket` function. The matrix was then initialized with a vector of ones to facilitate the matrix-vector multiplication.

2. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**:
   The core of this task was performing matrix-vector multiplication using the sparse matrix. This operation is crucial for various numerical methods and optimizations. By utilizing Eigen's capabilities, we achieved optimal performance in handling sparse matrices.

3. **Performance Measurement**:
   To evaluate the efficiency of our implementation, we measured the computation time for the matrix-vector multiplication. Using the `chrono` library, recorded the computation time in milliseconds, providing a clear indication of the performance.

4. **Result Storage**:
   The resulting vector from the matrix-vector multiplication was saved to a file in the `.mtx` format using Eigen's `saveMarketVector` function. This step ensures that the results are easily accessible and can be used for further analysis or verification.

### Key Highlights
- **Efficiency**: By using Eigen's sparse matrix capabilities, we achieved efficient matrix-vector multiplication, which is essential for handling large datasets.
- **Performance Tracking**: The inclusion of computation time measurement allows us to monitor and optimize the performance of our implementation.
- **Result Management**: Saving the results to a file is better for large matrices and makes it more suitable to be used in the future for other computations/tests.

### How to Use It
 **in the PMatrix directory**
1. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. **Run the Sparse Matrix Test**:
   ```bash
   ./main_Pmatrix --sparse sparse_matrix.mtx
   ```

### Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of the output:

```
